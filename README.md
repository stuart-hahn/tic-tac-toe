# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Overview

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is fully playable in the browser and includes a clean and modern user interface. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, with the objective of getting three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

## Features

- **Two-Player Mode:** Play against a friend in a local two-player mode.
- **Win/Tie Detection:** The game automatically detects when a player has won or when the game ends in a tie.
- **Responsive UI:** The game board and controls are responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.
- **Stylish Design:** Modern and user-friendly design with animations and interactive elements.
- **Restart Functionality:** Easily restart the game at any time to play another round.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Structure and layout of the game.
- **CSS3:** Styling and layout, including custom animations and responsive design.
- **JavaScript:** Game logic, including player turns, win/tie detection, and DOM manipulation.
